## üéÆDemo 

You can find a demo version [here](https://bartekdbc.github.io/to-do-list-react/).

## üìñDescription

I would like to invite you to take a look at my "To do list" application.

"To do list" is a web application which allows you to create a list of tasks that need to be done in the near future. 

There are two types of buttons next to each task:
- green button allows you to mark the task as completed or not ‚úÖ
- red button with trash icon is used to remove specific task from the board üóëÔ∏è.

Moreover, when you type tasks in the list, two additional functionalities appear - you can either hide completed tasks or complete all the tasks listed below.

This project is a part of Frontend Developer Course that I am currently participating in and was boostrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
